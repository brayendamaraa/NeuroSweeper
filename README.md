NeuroSweeper is an AI agent that can solve minesweeeper.

NeuroSweeper is built using 4 layers of convolutional layer. NeuroSweeper is trained based on 1000 games data generated by the traditional deterministic solver. It is trained to predict action based on given matrix state. The traditional deterministic solver has a win rate of 35% on expert difficulty so we can see a similar result on NeuroSweeper as well.
